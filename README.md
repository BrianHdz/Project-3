Our Project links together the vast source of music, podcasts and entertainment of Spotify with the ever growing expanse of media that is YouTube. Then sprinkles in a bit of a Twitter-esque messaging system to allow the user to talk about music and videos they find from the two API's and save their favorites within their profile to a personal homepage.
